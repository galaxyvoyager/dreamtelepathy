# dreamtelepathy
Researching how to record an event from the dream consciousness by validating Morse code signals from participants.

The dream research project will determine when an out-of-body experience from the dream coincides with a change 
in the electromagnetic field, barometeric pressure, and infrared spectrum a change from dream participants.

Make and program a series of microcontrollers to record time and date, electromagnetic fields,
and record real-time video of dream participants from remote locations using the private Intranet.
